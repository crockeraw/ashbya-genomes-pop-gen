# BIOS 611 Project
## Pop Gen Analysis (probably) --- Alex Crocker 2021

Probably going to do analysis on some genomic data that I already have. But may change my mind agian... 

The project will (might) include a Snakemake file that should not be run, but which was used to generate the data that is the subject of this project. 
It will also include the afformentioned data: a variant call file (VCF) for the genomes of 48 Ashbya gosepyii isolates. And it will include a bunch of analyses that get at whether all these isolates are in fact the same speices, whether distinct populations exist, and whether Asybha is recombing (has a sexual cycle).
