## Population genetic analysis of *Ashbya gossypii* --- Alex Crocker 2021

## Who is *Ashbya gossypii*? 
*Ashbya* is a filamentous fungus and a pretty close relative of the brewers yeast and all-star model organism *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. Although *Ashbya* is itself a faily popular model organism, only a couple of genomes are available on NCBI, and we still don't know much about its populations in nature. Here I am using new data to look at recombination, speciation, and other aspect of population structure in *Ashbya* isolated from insect and plant hosts. 

## What is the data I am working with?
In this project I am starting with a variant call file (VCF). VCFs list the differences between a reference sequence and sequences that are aligned to it. I have already produced a VCF with merged data from 48 wild isolates of the fungus *Ashbya gossypii*. For this project I subset the variant call file to include only the mitocondrial genome. Since it is relatively small I can host the data on Github, and run analyses on a laptop.
